She undressed me, without me even knowing, right there, beside the busy street. Cars whipping past her wicked green eyes, imagining God knows what, as I stepped off the curb to allow her full access of the sidewalk. I was oblivious enough but, a woman like her wouldn't let it stay that way.

Welcome to the first official story publication of The Inkwell, the exclusive outlet for sensual short stories by Beau Holliday. I've explored many communities of luscious, intoxicating writers since I made the important decision of bringing my craft to the digital world. While I appreciate the connections we've made online, my reserved nature requires a bit more privacy, especially when it comes to reading and writing sensual, and intense, romance. It has been my impression that my most loyal roses, share the same preferences.

So, The Inkwell is my private library. Away from the prying eyes of the general public, from the invasive advertising practices of social media, we have generated a more peaceful piece of the internet. Consider this your escape, your private room at a quiet resort. Find something you like and enjoy yourself. 

Occasionally, I will share some of my favorite submissions from valued guests. You can contribute to the Prompts if you'd like to share your own. Wether you're a reader, writer, or both, a poetess, a goddess, a secret slut, I hope you find yourself a comfortable place, here. 

I love to tease you. So, don't expect to get all of my long format routinely. I'll release them at just the right time but, if you find you can't wait for more, find the Read button in the navigation. This will take you to the sitewide feed, showcasing all of the latest Poems, Sentiments, and of course, recent Stories and Prompts. 

If your desire is still pressing, and you just need to tell me, I will attach my contact information, below.


Sincerely,
Beau Holliday
